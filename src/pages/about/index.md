## Helping Kids Be Their Best

Primary Children’s Hospital ranks among the best children’s hospitals in the United States. Located in Salt Lake City, Utah, our hospital is focused on providing the best care for more than 1 million children living in a 400,000 square-mile service area.



Our 289-bed facility is a Level I pediatric trauma center and cares for children with complex illness and injury, including organ transplants and complex birth defects. Our hospital is part of Intermountain Healthcare, a not-for-profit health care system, and the pediatric teaching hospital for the University of Utah, School of Medicine.



For more than 95 years, we have been helping children, families, and communities across the western United States. Our simple philosophy of The Child First and Always, informs every decision we make, and how we care for patients and families.
